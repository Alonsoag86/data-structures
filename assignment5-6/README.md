Weekly Assignment 5/6

The following submission is far from ideal. Talking to other classmates and after trying different ways to approach the Project, 
I came to the conclusion that the best way to do the cleaning was in two separate steps. 

For the first part I parsed the rest of the information for the meetings in zone 9. 
I thought I managed to pull everything out of the html, but, after reviewing the information carefully, 
I realized that the information for meeting type and Special Interest was showing the data for the very first item on the list. 
I tried to follow the same logic that got me the time and days, but, up until now, I have been unsuccessful to do so. 

Before I realized there was a problem with the data I was gathering. 
I proceeded to step number 2: adding the lat and long elements to the object. I didnâ€™t find any issues in this step.

The assignment will be completed as stated in the instructions. 
This submission is only meant to reflect the attempts I made and the elements that have been completed, 
as well as the work that still needs to be done.
